I've done stuff. I still do stuff. Right now, I'm at the <a href="https://neweconomy.net">New Economy Coalition</a>. I founded <a href="https://actsecure.org">ActSecure</a> a few years ago after trying to get it up and running several times. I'm also a co-director at <a href="https://securingchange.org">Securing Change</a> and that's pretty neat. I also believe that beer should be free as in freedom and as in beer.
